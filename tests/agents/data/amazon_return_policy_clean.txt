Amazon Return Policy
Easy shopping, simple returns - that's our promise
. At Amazon, we're committed to making your shopping experience as seamless and worry-free
               as possible. We understand that there may be times when a purchase may not meet your
               expectations or your needs might change. When that happens, we make completing a return
               simple and convenient.
Most items can be returned for a refund or replacement/exchange within 30 days of
               delivery as long as they are in original or unused condition. For eligible items,
               you can enjoy free returns at many locations near you. For information on an item's
               return eligibility, please check the product detail page before placing your order.
               After placing an order, you can find relevant information on an item's return eligibility
               in your
Order History
.
A refund will be provided if Amazon (or the third-party seller) has received the item,
               and determined that you are eligible for a refund. It can take up to 30 days for us
               to receive and process your return. In certain circumstances refund timeframes may
               be longer. If we need additional information about your return, we will notify you
               with instructions to contact Customer Service. For more information, please see our
Refunds
page.

            in this video.
Third-Party Seller Returns
When you order from a third-party seller that fulfills and ships their own inventory,
            your return is sent back to the seller instead of Amazon. Sellers must offer one of
            the following:
A return address within the United States where you can ship the item
A prepaid return label; or
A full refund without requesting the item be returned
For more information about returns to sellers, please refer to
Returns to Third-Party Sellers
.
Sending Us Your Return
You can return most items for free at over 8,000 convenient locations, typically
            within a 5-mile radius of your address. Additionally, most returns do not need to
            be boxed or labeled. Please ensure that your item is returned in
original or unused condition with tags attached and hygiene seals and liners intact,
               and in the original manufacturer's packaging including tags, components, accessories,
               manuals, certificates of authenticity, and other inserts.
Please return your item before the "return by date" shown in your return request
            confirmation email or in the "Return Request" tab in your
Order History
.
Please follow the return instructions for each item to receive a refund. Do not include
            items from separate orders in the same return.
If you have bought an item (for example, computers, electronics) on which you've
            saved personal information, please erase this information completely by following
            manufacturer instructions.

                           not in original condition, has tags removed or have obvious signs of use for reasons

            to third-party sellers. For more information about returns to sellers, please refer
            to

.
Discounted Purchases
If you return an item that was part of a discount qualification, we will reduce your
            refund to account for the return.
Returning a Gift
Go to the
Returns page
. Use the 17-digit order number, for example 123-1234567-1234567
(add: "how do I find this?" hover-over link)
on your packing slip that came with your item or on the digital gift receipt, to
            initiate a return. If you can't locate the order number, ask the gift giver. If you
            need an exchange or replacement, you'll need to return the gift and place a new order.
Kindle books you receive as a gift are eligible for exchange for an Amazon.com Gift
                  Card before acceptance.
Global Store Returns
Items shipped from Amazon.com, including Amazon Resale, can be returned within 30
               days of delivery, with some exceptions:
For most Amazon Global Store returns, you will be provided with a pre-paid UPS return
                        label which allows you to return the item(s) to any UPS drop-off point located across
                        the US. You can find your most convenient UPS location using the following link:
https://www.ups.com/dropoff/?loc=en_US
Not all Global Store products are eligible for a prepaid return. In this case, you
                        will need to return the item at your own expense. We recommend you return the item(s)
                        using a trackable method at the carrier of your choice.
It can take up to 25 days for an item to reach us once you return it. Once the item
                        is received and processed at our fulfillment center, it takes two business days for
                        the refund to be processed and 3-5 business days for the refund amount to show up
                        in your account.
Amazon will automatically refund up to $20 for return postage costs on receipt of
                        the item. If your return postage costs exceed $20, you may contact
Customer Service
to request a refund of the remaining postage cost. If you return a defective, damaged
                        or incorrect item, you'll be refunded the full postage cost, as well as your Import
                        Fees Deposit, once your return is processed.
Special Delivery Service Returns
Items delivered with
"Deluxe Delivery & Unpack"
and "
Deluxe Delivery & Assembly"
services qualify for an Instant Return at the point of delivery. Please visit our
Special Delivery Options
page for more details.
Product Warranties
Please contact the manufacturer directly for product registration and warranty-related
            information. A manufacturer warranty may not cover used products offered on Amazon.com.
            Review the manufacturer warranty details on the product detail page for coverage or
            contact the manufacturer directly.
Unintended Item(s) in My Return
If you accidentally sent the wrong item to Amazon, please contact
Customer Service
as soon as possible. Note that we may not be able to locate mistakenly sent items
            and are unable to provide compensation in these cases. Amazon does not store items
            sent in error and will handle (and/or dispose) such items at our discretion.
Returning Items Purchased in a Bundle
You must return all items purchased in a Bundle with Savings to receive a refund.
            Partial refunds are not available.
Note:
Amazon offers a convenient return service for reasonable use by our customers. Should
               customers abuse this service, we may adjust its availability.
For any return, Amazon may require additional information and documentation (such
               as a government-issued photo identification) during the processing of a return to
               help determine whether to provide a refund/replacement. Amazon reserves the right
               to take additional actions to prevent fraud or abuse (including denial of returns,
               refunds or exchanges, or imposing return fees). Amazon may modify this policy at any
               time.
